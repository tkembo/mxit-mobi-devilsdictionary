(180, 'CROSS', 'n. An ancient religious symbol erroneously supposed to owe its significance to the most solemn event in the history of Christianity but really antedating it by thousands of years. By many it has been believed to be identical with the crux ansata of the ancient phallic worship but it has been traced even beyond all that we know of that to the rites of primitive peoples. We have to-day the White Cross as a symbol of chastity and the Red Cross as a badge of benevolent neutrality in war. Having in mind the former the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape smites the lyre to the effect following:', 0),

(182, 'CUPID', 'n. The so-called god of love. This bastard creation of a barbarous fancy was no doubt inflicted upon mythology for the sins of its deities. Of all unbeautiful and inappropriate conceptions this is the most reasonless and offensive. The notion of symbolizing sexual love by a semisexless babe and comparing the pains of passion to the wounds of an arrowâ€”of introducing this pudgy homunculus into art grossly to materialize the subtle spirit and suggestion of the workâ€” this is eminently worthy of the age that giving it birth laid it on the doorstep of prosperity.', 0),
(183, 'CURIOSITY', 'n. An objectionable quality of the female mind. The desire to know whether or not a woman is cursed with curiosity is one of the most active and insatiable passions of the masculine soul.', 0),
(184, 'CURSE', 'v.t. Energetically to belabor with a verbal slap-stick. This is an operation which in literature particularly in the drama is commonly fatal to the victim. Nevertheless the liability to a cursing is a risk that cuts but a small figure in fixing the rates of life insurance.', 0),
(185, 'CYNIC', 'n. A blackguard whose faulty vision sees things as they are not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic''s eyes to improve his vision.', 0),
(186, 'DAMN', 'v. A word formerly much used by the Paphlagonians the meaning of which is lost. By the learned Dr. Dolabelly Gak it is believed to have been a term of satisfaction implying the highest possible degree of mental tranquillity. Professor Groke on the contrary thinks it expressed an emotion of tumultuous delight because it so frequently occurs in combination with the word jod or god meaning "joy." It would be with great diffidence that I should advance an opinion conflicting with that of either of these formidable authorities.', 0),
(187, 'DANCE', 'v.i. To leap about to the sound of tittering preferably with arms about your neighbor''s wife or daughter.

(190, 'DAWN', 'n. The time when men of reason go to bed. Certain old men prefer to rise at about that time taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point with pride to these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the truth being that they are hearty and old not because of their habits but in spite of them. The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has killed all the others who have tried it.', 0),
(191, 'DAY', 'n. A period of twenty-four hours the day proper and the night or day improperâ€”the former devoted to sins of business the latter consecrated to the other sort. These two kinds of social activity overlap. mostly misspent. This period is divided into two parts', 0),

(198, 'DEGENERATE', 'adj. Less conspicuously admirable than one''s ancestors. The contemporaries of Homer were striking examples of degeneracy; it required ten of them to raise a rock or a riot that one of the heroes of the Trojan war could have raised with ease. Homer never tires of sneering at "men who live in these degenerate days" which is perhaps why they suffered him to beg his breadâ€”a marked instance of returning good for evil by the way for if they had forbidden him he would certainly have starved.', 0),

This Divine Being in some of his smaller and silkier incarnations takes in the affection of Woman the place to which there is no human male aspirant. The Dog is a survivalâ€”an anachronism. He toils not neither does he spin yet Solomon in all his glory never lay upon a door-mat all day long sun-soaked and fly-fed and fat while his master worked for the means wherewith to purchase the idle wag of the Solomonic tail seasoned with a look of tolerant recognition.', 0),

Very little is now known about the Druids and their faith. Pliny says their religion originating in Britain spread eastward as far as Persia. Caesar says those who desired to study its mysteries went to Britain. Caesar himself went to Britain but does not appear to have obtained any high preferment in the Druidical Church although his talent for human sacrifice was considerable.', 0),

(232, 'DULLARD', 'n. A member of the reigning dynasty in letters and life. The Dullards came in with Adam and being both numerous and sturdy have overrun the habitable world. The secret of their power is their insensibility to blows; tickle them with a bludgeon and they laugh with a platitude. The Dullards came originally from Boeotia whence they were driven by stress of starvation their dullness having blighted the crops. For some centuries they infested Philistia and many of them are called Philistines to this day. In the turbulent times of the Crusades they withdrew thence and gradually overspread all Europe occupying most of the high places in politics art literature science and theology. Since a detachment of Dullards came over with the Pilgrims in the Mayflower and made a favorable report of the country their increase by birth immigration and conversion has been rapid and steady. According to the most trustworthy statistics the number of adult Dullards in the United States is but little short of thirty millions including the statisticians. The intellectual centre of the race is somewhere about Peoria Illinois but the New England Dullard is the most shockingly moral.', 0),

A person who combines the judicial functions of Minos Rhadamanthus and Aeacus but is placable with an obolus; a severely virtuous censor but so charitable withal that he tolerates the virtues of others and the vices of himself; who flings about him the splintering lightning and sturdy thunders of admonition till he resembles a bunch of firecrackers petulantly uttering his mind at the tail of a dog; then straightway murmurs a mild melodious lay soft as the cooing of a donkey intoning its prayer to the evening star. Master of mysteries and lord of law high-pinnacled upon the throne of thought his face suffused with the dim splendors of the Transfiguration his legs intertwisted and his tongue a-cheek the editor spills his will along the paper and cuts it off in lengths to suit. And at intervals from behind the veil of the temple is heard the voice of the foreman demanding three inches of wit and six lines of religious meditation or bidding him turn off the wisdom and whack up some pathos.', 0),

(241, 'EFFECT', 'n. The second of two phenomena which always occur together in the same order.

(250, 'EMBALM', 'v.i. To cheat vegetation by locking up the gases upon which it feeds. By embalming their dead and thereby deranging the natural balance between animal and vegetable life the Egyptians made their once fertile and populous country barren and incapable of supporting more than a meagre crew. The modern metallic burial casket is a step in the same direction and many a dead man who ought now to be ornamenting his neighbor''s lawn as a tree or enriching his table as a bunch of radishes is doomed to a long inutility.

(268, 'EVERLASTING', 'adj. Lasting forever. It is with no small diffidence that I venture to offer this brief and elementary definition for I am not unaware of the existence of a bulky volume by a sometime Bishop of Worcester entitled A Partial Definition of the Word "Everlasting" as Used in the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures. His book was once esteemed of great authority in the Anglican Church, and is still, I understand, studied with pleasure to the mind and profit of the soul.', 0),
(269, 'EXCEPTION', 'n. A thing which takes the liberty to differ from other things of its class as an honest man a truthful woman etc. "The exception proves the rule" is an expression constantly upon the lips of the ignorant who parrot it from one another with never a thought of its absurdity.

(277, 'FAIRY', 'n. A creature variously fashioned and endowed that formerly inhabited the meadows and forests. It was nocturnal in its habits and somewhat addicted to dancing and the theft of children. The fairies are now believed by naturalist to be extinct though a clergyman of the Church of England saw three near Colchester as lately as 1855 while passing through a park after dining with the lord of the manor. The sight greatly staggered him and he was so affected that his account of it was incoherent. In the year 1807 a troop of fairies visited a wood near Aix and carried off the daughter of a peasant who had been seen to enter it with a bundle of clothing. The son of a wealthy bourgeois disappeared about the same time but afterward returned. He had seen the abduction been in pursuit of the fairies. Justinian Gaux a writer of the fourteenth century avers that so great is the fairies'' power of transformation that he saw one change itself into two opposing armies and fight a battle with great slaughter and that the next day after it had resumed its original shape and gone away there were seven hundred bodies of the slain which the villagers had to bury. He does not say if any of the wounded recovered. In the time of Henry III of England a law was made which prescribed the death penalty for "Kyllynge wowndynge or mamynge" a fairy and it was universally respected.', 0),

In the Roman Catholic Church feasts are "movable" and "immovable" but the celebrants are uniformly immovable until they are full. In their earliest development these entertainments took the form of feasts for the dead; such were held by the Greeks under the name Nemeseia by the Aztecs and Peruvians as in modern times they are popular with the Chinese; though it is believed that the ancient dead like the modern were light eaters. Among the many feasts of the Romans was the Novemdiale which was held according to Livy whenever stones fell from heaven.', 0),

(292, 'FLY-SPECK', 'n. The prototype of punctuation. It is observed by Garvinus that the systems of punctuation in use by the various literary nations depended originally upon the social habits and general diet of the flies infesting the several countries. These creatures which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and companionable familiarity with authors liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth under the pen according to their bodily habit bringing out the sense of the work by a species of interpretation superior to and independent of the writer''s powers. The "old masters" of literatureâ€”that is to say the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics in the same languageâ€”never punctuated at all but worked right along free-handed without that abruption of the thought which comes from the use of points. (We observe the same thing in children to-day whose usage in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of development characterizing the infancy of races.) In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is found by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and chemical tests to have been inserted by the writers'' ingenious and serviceable collaborator the common house-flyâ€”Musca maledicta. In transcribing these ancient MSS for the purpose of either making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as divine revelations later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment to the unspeakable enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious advantages of these marks in their own work and with such assistance as the flies of their own household may be willing to grant frequently rival and sometimes surpass the older compositions in respect at least of punctuation which is no small glory. Fully to understand the important services that flies perform to literature it is only necessary to lay a page of some popular novelist alongside a saucer of cream-and-molasses in a sunny room and observe "how the wit brightens and the style refines" in accurate proportion to the duration of exposure.', 0),

(294, 'FOOL', 'n. A person who pervades the domain of intellectual speculation and diffuses himself through the channels of moral activity. He is omnific omniform omnipercipient omniscient omnipotent. He it was who invented letters printing the railroad the steamboat the telegraph the platitude and the circle of the sciences. He created patriotism and taught the nations warâ€”founded theology philosophy law medicine and Chicago. He established monarchical and republican government. He is from everlasting to everlastingâ€”such as creation''s dawn beheld he fooleth now. In the morning of time he sang upon primitive hills and in the noonday of existence headed the procession of being. His grandmotherly hand was warmly tucked-in the set sun of civilization and in the twilight he prepares Man''s evening meal of milk-and-morality and turns down the covers of the universal grave. And after the rest of us shall have retired for the night of eternal oblivion he will sit up to write a history of human civilization.', 0),

(296, 'FOREORDINATION', 'n. This looks like an easy word to define but when I consider that pious and learned theologians have spent long lives in explaining it and written libraries to explain their explanations; when I remember the nations have been divided and bloody battles caused by the difference between foreordination and predestination and that millions of treasure have been expended in the effort to prove and disprove its compatibility with freedom of the will and the efficacy of prayer praise and a religious lifeâ€”recalling these awful facts in the history of the word I stand appalled before the mighty problem of its signification abase my spiritual eyes fearing to contemplate its portentous magnitude reverently uncover and humbly refer it to His Eminence Cardinal Gibbons and His Grace Bishop Potter.', 0),

Formerly the knife was employed for this purpose and by many worthy persons is still thought to have many advantages over the other tool which however they do not altogether reject but use to assist in charging the knife.

"Ay" said the officer coldly "an ye will not pray him thence for naught he must e''en roast." "But look you my son" persisted the good man "this act hath rank as robbery of God!"

(303, 'FREEMASONS', 'n. An order with secret rites grotesque ceremonies and fantastic costumes which originating in the reign of Charles II among working artisans of London has been joined successively by the dead of past centuries in unbroken retrogression until now it embraces all the generations of man on the hither side of Adam and is drumming up distinguished recruits among the pre-Creational inhabitants of Chaos and Formless Void. The order was founded at different times by Charlemagne Julius Caesar Cyrus Solomon Zoroaster Confucious Thothmes and Buddha. Its emblems and symbols have been found in the Catacombs of Paris and Rome on the stones of the Parthenon and the Chinese Great Wall among the temples of Karnak and Palmyra and in the Egyptian Pyramidsâ€”always by a Freemason.', 0),

(305, 'FRIENDSHIP', 'n. A ship big enough to carry two in fair weather but only one in foul.', 0),
(306, 'FROG', 'n. A reptile with edible legs. The first mention of frogs in profane literature is in Homer''s narrative of the war between them and the mice. Skeptical persons have doubted Homer''s authorship of the work but the learned ingenious and industrious Dr. Schliemann has set the question forever at rest by uncovering the bones of the slain frogs. One of the forms of moral suasion by which Pharaoh was besought to favor the Israelities was a plague of frogs but Pharaoh who liked them fricasees remarked with truly oriental stoicism that he could stand it as long as the frogs and the Jews could; so the programme was changed. The frog is a diligent songster having a good voice but no ear. The libretto of his favorite opera as written by Aristophanes is brief simple and effectiveâ€”"brekekex-koax"; the music is apparently by that eminent composer Richard Wagner. Horses have a frog in each hoofâ€”a thoughtful provision of nature enabling them to shine in a hurdle race.', 0),
(307, 'FRYING-PAN', 'n. One part of the penal apparatus employed in that punitive institution a woman''s kitchen. The frying-pan was invented by Calvin and by him used in cooking span-long infants that had died without baptism; and observing one day the horrible torment of a tramp who had incautiously pulled a fried babe from the waste-dump and devoured it it occurred to the great divine to rob death of its terrors by introducing the frying-pan into every household in Geneva. Thence it spread to all corners of the world and has been of invaluable assistance in the propagation of his sombre faith. The following lines (said to be from the pen of his Grace Bishop Potter) seem to imply that the usefulness of this utensil is not limited to this world; but as the consequences of its employment in this life reach over into the life to come so also itself may be found on the other side rewarding its devotees:', 0),
(308, 'FUNERAL', 'n. A pageant whereby we attest our respect for the dead by enriching the undertaker and strengthen our grief by an expenditure that deepens our groans and doubles our tears.', 0),
(309, 'FUTURE', 'n. That period of time in which our affairs prosper our friends are true and our happiness is assured.', 0),
(310, 'GALLOWS', 'n. A stage for the performance of miracle plays', 0),
(311, 'GARGOYLE', 'n. A rain-spout projecting from the eaves of mediaeval buildings commonly fashioned into a grotesque caricature of some personal enemy of the architect or owner of the building. This was especially the case in churches and ecclesiastical structures generally in which the gargoyles presented a perfect rogues'' gallery of local heretics and controversialists. Sometimes when a new dean and chapter were installed the old gargoyles were removed and others substituted having a closer relation to the private animosities of the new incumbents.', 0),
(312, 'GARTHER', 'n. An elastic band intended to keep a woman from coming out of her stockings and desolating the country.', 0),
(313, 'GENEROUS', 'adj. Originally this word meant noble by birth and was rightly applied to a great multitude of persons. It now means noble by nature and is taking a bit of a rest.', 0),

(317, 'GEOLOGY', 'n. The science of the earth''s crustâ€”to which doubtless will be added that of its interior whenever a man shall come up garrulous out of a well. The geological formations of the globe already noted are catalogued thus: The Primary or lower one consists of rocks bones or mired mules gas-pipes miners'' tools antique statues minus the nose Spanish doubloons and ancestors. The Secondary is largely made up of red worms and moles. The Tertiary comprises railway tracks patent pavements grass snakes mouldy boots beer bottles tomato cans intoxicated citizens garbage anarchists snap-dogs and fools.', 0),
(318, 'GHOST', 'n. The outward and visible sign of an inward fear.', 0),
(319, 'GHOUL', 'n. A demon addicted to the reprehensible habit of devouring the dead. The existence of ghouls has been disputed by that class of controversialists who are more concerned to deprive the world of comforting beliefs than to give it anything good in their place. In 1640 Father Secchi saw one in a cemetery near and he saw it in more than one place at a time. The good man was coming away from dinner at the time and explains that if he had not been "heavy with eating" he would have seized the demon at all hazards. Atholston relates that a ghoul was caught by some sturdy peasants in a churchyard at Sudbury and ducked in a horsepond. (He appears to think that so distinguished a criminal should have been ducked in a tank of rosewater.) The water turned at once to blood "and so contynues unto ys daye." The pond has since been bled with a ditch. As late as the beginning of the fourteenth century a ghoul was cornered in the crypt of the cathedral at Amiens and the whole population surrounded the place. Twenty armed men with a priest at their head bearing a crucifix entered and captured the ghoul which thinking to escape by the stratagem had transformed itself to the semblance of a well known citizen but was nevertheless hanged drawn and quartered in the midst of hideous popular orgies. The citizen whose shape the demon had assumed was so affected by the sinister occurrence that he never again showed himself in Amiens and his fate remains a mystery.Florence and frightened it away with the sign of the cross. He describes it as gifted with many heads an an uncommon allowance of limbs', 0),

(321, 'GNOME', 'n. In North-European mythology a dwarfish imp inhabiting the interior parts of the earth and having special custody of mineral treasures. Bjorsen who died in 1765 says gnomes were common enough in the southern parts of Sweden in his boyhood and he frequently saw them scampering on the hills in the evening twilight. Ludwig Binkerhoof saw three as recently as 1792 in the Black Forest and Sneddeker avers that in 1803 they drove a party of miners out of a Silesian mine. Basing our computations upon data supplied by these statements we find that the gnomes were probably extinct as early as 1764.', 0),

(325, 'GOOSE', 'n. A bird that supplies quills for writing. These by some occult process of nature are penetrated and suffused with various degrees of the bird''s intellectual energies and emotional character so that when inked and drawn mechanically across paper by a person called an "author" there results a very fair and accurate transcript of the fowl''s thought and feeling. The difference in geese as discovered by this ingenious method is considerable: many are found to have only trivial and insignificant powers but some are seen to be very great geese indeed.', 0),
(326, 'GOUT', 'n. A physician''s name for the rheumatism of a rich patient.', 0),
(327, 'GRACES', 'n. Three beautiful goddesses Aglaia Thalia and Euphrosyne who attended upon Venus serving without salary. They were at no expense for board and clothing for they ate nothing to speak of and dressed according to the weather wearing whatever breeze happened to be blowing.', 0),

(331, 'GRAVITATION', 'n. The tendency of all bodies to approach one another with a strength proportion to the quantity of matter they containâ€” the quantity of matter they contain being ascertained by the strength of their tendency to approach one another. This is a lovely and edifying illustration of how science having made A the proof of B makes B the proof of A.', 0),
(332, 'GUILLOTINE', 'n. A machine which makes a Frenchman shrug his shoulders with good reason.', 0),
(333, 'GUNPOWDER', 'n. An agency employed by civilized nations for the settlement of disputes which might become troublesome if left unadjusted. By most writers the invention of gunpowder is ascribed to the Chinese but not upon very convincing evidence. Milton says it was invented by the devil to dispel angels with and this opinion seems to derive some support from the scarcity of angels. Moreover it has the hearty concurrence of the Hon. James Wilson Secretary of Agriculture.', 0),

(337, 'HAG', 'n. An elderly lady whom you do not happen to like; sometimes called also a hen or cat. Old witches sorceresses etc. were called hags from the belief that their heads were surrounded by a kind of baleful lumination or nimbusâ€”hag being the popular name of that peculiar electrical light sometimes observed in the hair. At one time hag was not a word of reproach: Drayton speaks of a "beautiful hag all smiles" much as Shakespeare said "sweet wench." It would not now be proper to call your sweetheart a hagâ€”that compliment is reserved for the use of her grandchildren.', 0),
(338, 'HALF', 'n. One of two equal parts into which a thing may be divided or considered as divided. In the fourteenth century a heated discussion arose among theologists and philosophers as to whether Omniscience could part an object into three halves; and the pious Father Aldrovinus publicly prayed in the cathedral at Rouen that God would demonstrate the affirmative of the proposition in some signal and unmistakable way and particularly (if it should please Him) upon the body of that hardy blasphemer Manutius Procinus who maintained the negative. Procinus however was spared to die of the bite of a viper.', 0),
(339, 'HALO', 'n. Properly a luminous ring encircling an astronomical body but not infrequently confounded with "aureola" or "nimbus" a somewhat similar phenomenon worn as a head-dress by divinities and saints. The halo is a purely optical illusion produced by moisture in the air in the manner of a rainbow; but the aureola is conferred as a sign of superior sanctity in the same way as a bishop''s mitreor the Pope''s tiara. In the painting of the Nativity by Szedgkin a pious artist of Pesth not only do the Virgin and the Child wear the nimbus but an ass nibbling hay from the sacred manger is similarly decorated and to his lasting honor be it said appears to bear his unaccustomed dignity with a truly saintly grace.', 0),
(340, 'HAND', 'n. A singular instrument worn at the end of the human arm and commonly thrust into somebody''s pocket.', 0),
(341, 'HANDKERCHIEF', 'n. A small square of silk or linen used in various ignoble offices about the face and especially serviceable at funerals to conceal the lack of tears. The handkerchief is of recent invention; our ancestors knew nothing of it and intrusted its duties to the sleeve. Shakespeare''s introducing it into the play of "Othello" is an anachronism: Desdemona dried her nose with her skirt as Dr. Mary Walker and other reformers have done with their coattails in our own dayâ€”an evidence that revolutions sometimes go backward.', 0),
(342, 'HANGMAN', 'n. An officer of the law charged with duties of the highest dignity and utmost gravity and held in hereditary disesteem by a populace having a criminal ancestry. In some of the American States his functions are now performed by an electrician as in New Jersey where executions by electricity have recently been orderedâ€”the first instance known to this lexicographer of anybody questioning the expediency of hanging Jerseymen.', 0),

(351, 'HEARSE', 'n. Death''s baby-carriage.', 0),
(352, 'HEART', 'n. An automatic muscular blood-pump. Figuratively this useful organ is said to be the seat of emotions and sentimentsâ€”a very pretty fancy which however is nothing but a survival of a once universal belief. It is now known that the sentiments and emotions reside in the stomach being evolved from food by chemical action of the gastric fluid. The exact process by which a beefsteak becomes a feelingâ€”tender or not according to the age of the animal from which it was cut; the successive stages of elaboration through which a caviar sandwich is transmuted to a quaint fancy and reappears as a pungent epigram; the marvelous functional methods of converting a hard-boiled egg into religious contrition or a cream-puff into a sigh of sensibilityâ€”these things have been patiently ascertained by M. Pasteur and by him expounded with convincing lucidity. (See also, my monograph, The Essential Identity of the Spiritual Affections and Certain Intestinal Gases Freed in Digestionâ€”4to 687 pp.) In a scientific work entitled: I believe, Delectatio Demonorum (John Camden Hotton, London, 1873) this view of the sentiments receives a striking illustration; and for further light consult Professor Dam''s famous treatise on Love as a Product of Alimentary Maceration.', 0),

(359, 'HIBERNATE', 'v.i. To pass the winter season in domestic seclusion. There have been many singular popular notions about the hibernation of various animals. Many believe that the bear hibernates during the whole winter and subsists by mechanically sucking its paws. It is admitted that it comes out of its retirement in the spring so lean that it had to try twice before it can cast a shadow. Three or four centuries ago in England no fact was better attested than that swallows passed the winter months in the mud at the bottom of their brooks clinging together in globular masses. They have apparently been compelled to give up the custom and account of the foulness of the brooks. Sotus Ecobius discovered in Central Asia a whole nation of people who hibernate. By some investigators the fasting of Lent is supposed to have been originally a modified form of hibernation to which the Church gave a religious significance; but this view was strenuously opposed by that eminent authority Bishop Kip who did not wish any honors denied to the memory of the Founder of his family.', 0),
(360, 'HIPPOGRIFF', 'n. An animal (now extinct) which was half horse and half griffin. The griffin was itself a compound creature half lion and half eagle. The hippogriff was actually therefore a one-quarter eagle which is two dollars and fifty cents in gold. The study of zoology is full of surprises.', 0),

(363, 'HOG', 'n. A bird remarkable for the catholicity of its appetite and serving to illustrate that of ours. Among the Mahometans and Jews the hog is not in favor as an article of diet but is respected for the delicacy and the melody of its voice. It is chiefly as a songster that the fowl is esteemed; the cage of him in full chorus has been known to draw tears from two persons at once. The scientific name of this dicky-bird is Porcus Rockefelleri. Mr. Rockefeller did not discover the hog but it is considered his by right of resemblance.', 0),
(364, 'HOMOEOPATHIST', 'n. The humorist of the medical profession.', 0),
(365, 'HOMOEOPATHY', 'n. A school of medicine midway between Allopathy and Christian Science. To the last both the others are distinctly inferior for Christian Science will cure imaginary diseases and they can not.', 0),
(366, 'HOMICIDE', 'n. The slaying of one human being by another. There are four kinds of homocide: felonious excusable justifiable and praiseworthy but it makes no great difference to the person slain whether he fell by one kind or anotherâ€”the classification is for advantage of the lawyers.', 0),

(386, 'I', 'is the first letter of the alphabet, the first word of the language, the first thought of the mind, the first object of affection. In grammar it is a pronoun of the first person and singular number. Its plural is said to be We but how there can be more than one myself is doubtless clearer the grammarians than it is to the author of this incomparable dictionary. Conception of two myselfs is difficult but fine. The frank yet graceful use of "I" distinguishes a good writer from a bad; the latter carries it with the manner of a thief trying to cloak his loot.', 0),
(387, 'ICHOR', 'n. A fluid that serves the gods and goddesses in place of blood.', 0),
(388, 'ICONOCLAST', 'n. A breaker of idols the worshipers whereof are imperfectly gratified by the performance and most strenuously protest that he unbuildeth but doth not reedify that he pulleth down but pileth not up. For the poor things would have other idols in place of those he thwacketh upon the mazzard and dispelleth.

(389, 'IDIOT', 'n. A member of a large and powerful tribe whose influence in human affairs has always been dominant and controlling. The Idiot''s activity is not confined to any special field of thought or action but "pervades and regulates the whole." He has the last word in everything; his decision is unappealable.

If man''s notions of right and wrong have any other basis than this of expediency; if they originated or could have originated in any other way; if actions have in themselves a moral character apart from and nowise dependent on their consequencesâ€”then all philosophy is a lie and reason a disorder of the mind.', 0),
(399, 'IMPALE', 'v.t. In popular usage to pierce with any weapon which remains fixed in the wound. This however is inaccurate; to impale is properly to put to death by thrusting an upright sharp stake into the body the victim being left in a sitting position. This was a common mode of punishment among many of the nations of antiquity and is still in high favor in China and other parts of Asia. Down to the beginning of the fifteenth century it was widely employed in "churching" heretics and schismatics. Wolecraft calls it the "stoole of repentynge" and among the common people it was jocularly known as "riding the one legged horse." Ludwig Salzmann informs us that in Thibet impalement is considered the most appropriate punishment for crimes against religion; and although in China it is sometimes awarded for secular offences it is most frequently adjudged in cases of sacrilege. To the person in actual experience of impalement it must be a matter of minor importance by what kind of civil or religious dissent he was made acquainted with its discomforts; but doubtless he would feel a certain satisfaction if able to contemplate himself in the character of a weather-cock on the spire of the True Church.', 0),

(406, 'INADMISSIBLE', 'adj. Not competent to be considered. Said of certain kinds of testimony which juries are supposed to be unfit to be entrusted with and which judges therefore rule out even of proceedings before themselves alone. Hearsay evidence is inadmissible because the person quoted was unsworn and is not before the court for examination; yet most momentous actions military political commercial and of every other kind are daily undertaken on hearsay evidence. There is no religion in the world that has any other basis than hearsay evidence. Revelation is hearsay evidence; that the Scriptures are the word of God we have only the testimony of men long dead whose identity is not clearly established and who are not known to have been sworn in any sense. Under the rules of evidence as they now exist in this country no single assertion in the Bible has in its support any evidence admissible in a court of law. It cannot be proved that the battle of Blenheim ever was fought that there was such as person as Julius Caesar such an empire as Assyria.', 0),
(407, 'INAUSPICIOUSLY', 'adv. In an unpromising manner the auspices being unfavorable. Among the Romans it was customary before undertaking any important action or enterprise to obtain from the augurs or state prophets some hint of its probable outcome; and one of their favorite and most trustworthy modes of divination consisted in observing the flight of birdsâ€”the omens thence derived being called auspices. Newspaper reporters and certain miscreant lexicographers have decided that the wordâ€”always in the pluralâ€”shall mean "patronage" or "management"; as "The festivities were under the auspices of the Ancient and Honorable Order of Body-Snatchers"; or "The hilarities were auspicated by the Knights of Hunger."', 0),
(408, 'INCOME', 'n. The natural and rational gauge and measure of respectability the commonly accepted standards being artificial arbitrary and fallacious; for as "Sir Sycophas Chrysolater" in the play has justly remarked "the true use and function of property (in whatsoever it consistethâ€”coins or land or houses or merchant-stuff or anything which may be named as holden of right to one''s own subservience) as also of honors titles preferments and place and all favor and acquaintance of persons of quality or ableness are but to get money. Hence it followeth that all things are truly to be rated as of worth in measure of their serviceableness to that end; and their possessors should take rank in agreement thereto neither the lord of an unproducing manor howsoever broad and ancient nor he who bears an unremunerate dignity nor yet the pauper favorite of a king being esteemed of level excellency with him whose riches are of daily accretion; and hardly should they whose wealth is barren claim and rightly take more honor than the poor and unworthy."', 0),

(410, 'INCOMPOSSIBLE', 'adj. Unable to exist if something else exists. Two things are incompossible when the world of being has scope enough for one of them but not enough for bothâ€”as Walt Whitman''s poetry and God''s mercy to man. Incompossibility it will be seen is only incompatibility let loose. Instead of such low language as "Go heel yourselfâ€”I mean to kill you on sight" the words "Sir we are incompossible" would convey and equally significant intimation and in stately courtesy are altogether superior.', 0),
(411, 'INCUBUS', 'n. One of a race of highly improper demons who though probably not wholly extinct may be said to have seen their best nights.

(414, 'INDIFFERENT', 'adj. Imperfectly sensible to distinctions among things.', 0),
(415, 'INDIGESTION', 'n. A disease which the patient and his friends frequently mistake for deep religious conviction and concern for the salvation of mankind.

(418, 'INFANCY', 'n. The period of our lives when according to Wordsworth "Heaven lies about us." The world begins lying about us pretty soon afterward.', 0),
(419, 'INFERIAE', 'n. [Latin] Among the Greeks and Romans sacrifices for propitiation of the Dii Manes or souls of the dead heroes; for the pious ancients could not invent enough gods to satisfy their spiritual needs and had to have a number of makeshift deities or as a sailor might say jury-gods which they made out of the most unpromising materials. It was while sacrificing a bullock to the spirit of Agamemnon that Laiaides a priest of Aulis was favored with an audience of that illustrious warrior''s shade who prophetically recounted to him the birth of Christ and the triumph of Christianity giving him also a rapid but tolerably complete review of events down to the reign of Saint Louis. The narrative ended abruptly at the point owing to the inconsiderate crowing of a cock which compelled the ghosted King of Men to scamper back to Hades. There is a fine mediaeval flavor to this story and as it has not been traced back further than Pere Brateille a pious but obscure writer at the court of Saint Louis we shall probably not err on the side of presumption in considering it apocryphal though Monsignor Capel''s judgment of the matter might be different; and to that I bowâ€”wow.', 0),
(420, 'INFIDEL', 'n. In New York one who does not believe in the Christian religion; in Constantinople, one who does. (See GIAOUR.) A kind of scoundrel imperfectly reverent of and niggardly contributory to, divines, ecclesiastics, popes, parsons, canons, monks, mollahs, voodoos, presbyters, hierophants, prelates, obeah-men, abbes, nuns, missionaries, exhorters, deacons, friars, hadjis, high-priests, muezzins, brahmins, medicine-men, confessors, eminences, elders, primates, prebendaries pilgrims, prophets, imaums, beneficiaries, clerks, vicars-choral, archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, preachers, padres, abbotesses, caloyers, palmers, curates, patriarchs, bonezs, santons, beadsmen, canonesses, residentiaries, diocesans, deans, subdeans, rural deans, abdals, charm-sellers, archdeacons, hierarchs, class-leaders, incumbents, capitulars, sheiks, talapoins, postulants, scribes, gooroos, precentors, beadles, fakeers, sextons, reverences, revivalists, cenobites, perpetual curates, chaplains, mudjoes, readers, novices, vicars, rabbis, ulemas, lamas, sacristans, vergers, dervises, lectors, church wardens, cardinals, prioresses, suffragans, acolytes, rectors, cures, sophis, mutifs and pumpums.', 0),
(421, 'INFLUENCE', 'a visionary quo given in exchange for a substantial quid. n. In politics', 0),
(422, 'INFRALAPSARIAN', 'n. One who ventures to believe that Adam need not have sinned unless he had a mind toâ€”in opposition to the Supralapsarians who hold that that luckless person''s fall was decreed from the beginning. Infralapsarians are sometimes called Sublapsarians without material effect upon the importance and lucidity of their views about Adam.', 0),

(424, 'INJURY', 'n. An offense next in degree of enormity to a slight.', 0),
(425, 'INJUSTICE', 'n. A burden which of all those that we load upon others and carry ourselves is lightest in the hands and heaviest upon the back.', 0),
(426, 'INK', 'n. A villainous compound of tannogallate of iron gum-arabic and water chiefly used to facilitate the infection of idiocy and promote intellectual crime. The properties of ink are peculiar and contradictory: it may be used to make reputations and unmake them; to blacken them and to make them white; but it is most generally and acceptably employed as a mortar to bind together the stones of an edifice of fame and as a whitewash to conceal afterward the rascal quality of the material. There are men called journalists who have established ink baths which some persons pay money to get into others to get out of. Not infrequently it occurs that a person who has paid to get in pays twice as much to get out.', 0),
(427, 'INNATE', 'adj. Natural inherentâ€”as innate ideas that is to say ideas that we are born with having had them previously imparted to us. The doctrine of innate ideas is one of the most admirable faiths of philosophy being itself an innate idea and therefore inaccessible to disproof though Locke foolishly supposed himself to have given it "a black eye." Among innate ideas may be mentioned the belief in one''s ability to conduct a newspaper in the greatness of one''s country in the superiority of one''s civilization in the importance of one''s personal affairs and in the interesting nature of one''s diseases.', 0),
(428, 'IN''ARDS', 'n. The stomach, heart, soul and other bowels. Many eminent investigators do not class the soul as an in''ard but that acute observer and renowned authority Dr. Gunsaulus is persuaded that the mysterious organ known as the spleen is nothing less than our important part. To the contrary Professor Garrett P. Servis holds that man''s soul is that prolongation of his spinal marrow which forms the pith of his no tail; and for demonstration of his faith points confidently to the fact that no tailed animals have no souls. Concerning these two theories it is best to suspend judgment by believing both.', 0),
(429, 'INSCRIPTION', 'n. Something written on another thing. Inscriptions are of many kinds but mostly memorial intended to commemorate the fame of some illustrious person and hand down to distant ages the record of his services and virtues. To this class of inscriptions belongs the name of John Smith penciled on the Washington monument. Following are examples of memorial inscriptions on tombstones: (See EPITAPH.)', 0),

(433, 'INTERPRETER', 'n. One who enables two persons of different languages to understand each other by repeating to each what it would have been to the interpreter''s advantage for the other to have said.', 0),
(434, 'INTERREGNUM', 'n. The period during which a monarchical country is governed by a warm spot on the cushion of the throne. The experiment of letting the spot grow cold has commonly been attended by most unhappy results from the zeal of many worthy persons to make it warm again.', 0),

INSERT INTO `word` (`word_id`, `word`, `definition`, `is_featured`) VALUES
(436, 'INTRODUCTION', 'n. A social ceremony invented by the devil for the gratification of his servants and the plaguing of his enemies. The introduction attains its most malevolent development in this century being indeed closely related to our political system. Every American being the equal of every other American it follows that everybody has the right to know everybody else which implies the right to introduce without request or permission.', 0),

(438, 'IRRELIGION', 'n. The principal one of the great faiths of the world.', 0),
(439, 'ITCH', 'n. The patriotism of a Scotchman.', 0),
(440, 'J', 'is a consonant in English but some nations use it as a vowelâ€” than which nothing could be more absurd. Its original form which has been but slightly modified was that of the tail of a subdued dog and it was not a letter but a character standing for a Latin verb jacere "to throw" because when a stone is thrown at a dog the dog''s tail assumes that shape. This is the origin of the letter as expounded by the renowned Dr. Jocolpus Bumer of the University of Belgrade who established his conclusions on the subject in a work of three quarto volumes and committed suicide on being reminded that the j in the Roman alphabet had originally no curl.', 0),
(441, 'JEALOUS', 'adj. Unduly concerned about the preservation of that which can be lost only if not worth keeping.', 0),
(442, 'JESTER', 'n. An officer formerly attached to a king''s household whose business it was to amuse the court by ludicrous actions and utterances the absurdity being attested by his motley costume. The king himself being attired with dignity it took the world some centuries to discover that his own conduct and decrees were sufficiently ridiculous for the amusement not only of his court but of all mankind. The jester was commonly called a fool but the poets and romancers have ever delighted to represent him as a singularly wise and witty person. In the circus of to-day the melancholy ghost of the court fool effects the dejection of humbler audiences with the same jests wherewith in life he gloomed the marble hall panged the patrician sense of humor and tapped the tank of royal tears.', 0),
(443, 'JEWS-HARP', 'n. An unmusical instrument played by holding it fast with the teeth and trying to brush it away with the finger.', 0),

(445, 'JUSTICE', 'n. A commodity which is a more or less adulterated condition the State sells to the citizen as a reward for his allegiance taxes and personal service.', 0),
(459, 'K', 'is a consonant that we get from the Greeks but it can be traced away back beyond them to the Cerathians a small commercial nation inhabiting the peninsula of Smero. In their tongue it was called Klatch which means "destroyed." The form of the letter was originally precisely that of our H but the erudite Dr. Snedeker explains that it was altered to its present shape to commemorate the destruction of the great temple of Jarute by an earthquake circa 730 B.C. This building was famous for the two lofty columns of its portico one of which was broken in half by the catastrophe the other remaining intact. As the earlier form of the letter is supposed to have been suggested by these pillars so it is thought by the great antiquary its later was adopted as a simple and naturalâ€”not to say touchingâ€”means of keeping the calamity ever in the national memory. It is not known if the name of the letter was altered as an additional mnemonic or if the name was always Klatch and the destruction one of nature''s puns. As each theory seems probable enough I see no objection to believing bothâ€”and Dr. Snedeker arrayed himself on that side of the question.', 0),
(460, 'KILL', 'v.t. To create a vacancy without nominating a successor.', 1),

(465, 'KISS', 'n. A word invented by the poets as a rhyme for "bliss." It is supposed to signify in a general way some kind of rite or ceremony appertaining to a good understanding; but the manner of its performance is unknown to this lexicographer.', 0),
(466, 'KLEPTOMANIAC', 'n. A rich thief.', 0),
(467, 'KORAN', 'n. A book which the Mohammedans foolishly believe to have been written by divine inspiration but which Christians know to be a wicked imposture contradictory to the Holy Scriptures.', 0),
(468, 'LABOR', 'n. One of the processes by which A acquires property for B.', 0),
(469, 'LAND', 'n. A part of the earth''s surface considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society and is eminently worthy of the superstructure. Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born or born as trespassers to exist.', 0),
(470, 'LANGUAGE', 'n. The music with which we charm the serpents guarding another''s treasure.', 0),
(471, 'LAOCOON', 'n. A famous piece of antique scripture representing a priest of that name and his two sons in the folds of two enormous serpents. The skill and diligence with which the old man and lads support the serpents and keep them up to their work have been justly regarded as one of the noblest artistic illustrations of the mastery of human intelligence over brute inertia.', 0),
(472, 'LAP', 'n. One of the most important organs of the female systemâ€”an admirable provision of nature for the repose of infancy but chiefly useful in rural festivities to support plates of cold chicken and heads of adult males. The male of our species has a rudimentary lap imperfectly developed and in no way contributing to the animal''s substantial welfare.', 0),
(473, 'LAST', 'n. A shoemaker''s implement named by a frowning Providence as opportunity to the maker of puns.', 0),
(474, 'LAUGHTER', 'n. An interior convulsion producing a distortion of the features and accompanied by inarticulate noises. It is infectious and though intermittent incurable. Liability to attacks of laughter is one of the characteristics distinguishing man from the animalsâ€” these being not only inaccessible to the provocation of his example but impregnable to the microbes having original jurisdiction in bestowal of the disease. Whether laughter could be imparted to animals by inoculation from the human patient is a question that has not been answered by experimentation. Dr. Meir Witchell holds that the infection character of laughter is due to the instantaneous fermentation of sputa diffused in a spray. From this peculiarity he names the disorder Convulsio spargens.', 0),
(475, 'LAUREATE', 'adj. Crowned with leaves of the laurel. In England the Poet Laureate is an officer of the sovereign''s court acting as dancing skeleton at every royal feast and singing-mute at every royal funeral. Of all incumbents of that high office Robert Southey had the most notable knack at drugging the Samson of public joy and cutting his hair to the quick; and he had an artistic color-sense which enabled him so to blacken a public grief as to give it the aspect of a national crime.', 0),
(476, 'LAUREL', 'n. The laurus, a vegetable dedicated to Apollo and formerly defoliated to wreathe the brows of victors and such poets as had influence at court. (Vide supra.)', 0),

(480, 'LEAD', 'n. A heavy blue-gray metal much used in giving stability to light loversâ€”particularly to those who love not wisely but other men''s wives. Lead is also of great service as a counterpoise to an argument of such weight that it turns the scale of debate the wrong way. An interesting fact in the chemistry of international controversy is that at the point of contact of two patriotisms lead is precipitated in great quantities.', 0),
(481, 'LEARNING', 'n. The kind of ignorance distinguishing the studious.', 0),
(482, 'LECTURER', 'n. One with his hand in your pocket his tongue in your ear and his faith in your patience.', 1),
(483, 'LEGACY', 'n. A gift from one who is legging it out of this vale of tears.', 0),
(484, 'LEONINE', 'adj. Unlike a menagerie lion. Leonine verses are those in which a word in the middle of a line rhymes with a word at the end.', 0),
(485, 'LETTUCE', 'n. An herb of the genus Lactuca "Wherewith" says that pious gastronome Hengist Pelly "God has been pleased to reward the good and punish the wicked. For by his inner light the righteous man has discerned a manner of compounding for it a dressing to the appetency whereof a multitude of gustible condiments conspire being reconciled and ameliorated with profusion of oil the entire comestible making glad the heart of the godly and causing his face to shine. But the person of spiritual unworth is successfully tempted to the Adversary to eat of lettuce with destitution of oil, mustard, egg, salt and garlic and with a rascal bath of vinegar polluted with sugar. Wherefore the person of spiritual unworth suffers an intestinal pang of strange complexity and raises the song."', 0),
(486, 'LEVIATHAN', 'n. An enormous aquatic animal mentioned by Job. Some suppose it to have been the whale but that distinguished ichthyologer Dr. Jordan of Stanford University maintains with considerable heat that it was a species of gigantic Tadpole (Thaddeus Polandensis) or Polliwigâ€”Maria pseudo-hirsuta. For an exhaustive description and history of the Tadpole consult the famous monograph of Jane Potter Thaddeus of Warsaw.', 0),
(487, 'LEXICOGRAPHER', 'n. A pestilent fellow who under the pretense of recording some particular stage in the development of a language does what he can to arrest its growth stiffen its flexibility and mechanize its methods. For your lexicographer having written his dictionary comes to be considered "as one having authority" whereas his function is only to make a record not to give a law. The natural servility of the human understanding having invested him with judicial power surrenders its right of reason and submits itself to a chronicle as if it were a statue. Let the dictionary (for example) mark a good word as "obsolete" or "obsolescent" and few men thereafter venture to use it whatever their need of it and however desirable its restoration to favorâ€”whereby the process of impoverishment is accelerated and speech decays. On the contrary recognizing the truth that language must grow by innovation if it grow at all makes new words and uses the old in an unfamiliar sense has no following and is tartly reminded that "it isn''t in the dictionary" â€”although down to the time of the first lexicographer (Heaven forgive him!) no author ever had used a word that was in the dictionary. In the golden prime and high noon of English speech; when from the lips of the great Elizabethans fell words that made their own meaning and carried it in their very sound; when a Shakespeare and a Bacon were possible and the language now rapidly perishing at one end and slowly renewed at the other was in vigorous growth and hardy preservationâ€”sweeter than honey and stronger than a lionâ€”the lexicographer was a person unknown the dictionary a creation which his Creator had not created him to create.', 0),
(488, 'LIAR', 'n. A lawyer with a roving commission.', 0),
(489, 'LIBERTY', 'n. One of Imagination''s most precious possessions.', 0),
(490, 'LICKSPITTLE', 'n. A useful functionary not infrequently found editing a newspaper. In his character of editor he is closely allied to the blackmailer by the tie of occasional identity; for in truth the lickspittle is only the blackmailer under another aspect although the latter is frequently found as an independent species. Lickspittling is more detestable than blackmailing precisely as the business of a confidence man is more detestable than that of a highway robber; and the parallel maintains itself throughout for whereas few robbers will cheat every sneak will plunder if he dare.', 0),
(491, 'LIFE', 'n. A spiritual pickle preserving the body from decay. We live in daily apprehension of its loss; yet when lost it is not missed. The question "Is life worth living?" has been much discussed; particularly by those who think it is not many of whom have written at great length in support of their view and by careful observance of the laws of health enjoyed for long terms of years the honors of successful controversy.', 0),
(492, 'LIGHTHOUSE', 'n. A tall building on the seashore in which the government maintains a lamp and the friend of a politician.', 0),
(493, 'LIMB', 'n. The branch of a tree or the leg of an American woman.', 0),

(496, 'LITIGATION', 'n. A machine which you go into as a pig and come out of as a sausage.', 0),
(497, 'LIVER', 'n. A large red organ thoughtfully provided by nature to be bilious with. The sentiments and emotions which every literary anatomist now knows to haunt the heart were anciently believed to infest the liver; and even Gascoygne speaking of the emotional side of human nature calls it "our hepaticall parte." It was at one time considered the seat of life; hence its nameâ€”liver the thing we live with. The liver is heaven''s best gift to the goose; without it that bird would be unable to supply us with the Strasbourg pate.', 0),
(498, 'LL.D. ', 'Letters indicating the degree Legumptionorum Doctor. \nOne learned in laws gifted with legal gumption. Some suspicion is cast upon this derivation by the fact that the title was formerly LL.d. and conferred only upon gentlemen distinguished for their wealth. At the date of this writing Columbia University is considering the expediency of making another degree for clergymen in place of the old D.D.â€”Damnator Diaboli. The new honor will be known as Sanctorum Custus and written $$c. The name of the Rev. John Satan has been suggested as a suitable recipient by a lover of consistency who points out that Professor Harry Thurston Peck has long enjoyed the advantage of a degree.', 0),
(499, 'LOCK-AND-KEY', 'n. The distinguishing device of civilization and enlightenment.', 0),
(500, 'LODGER', 'n. A less popular name for the Second Person of that delectable newspaper Trinity: the Roomer, the Bedder and the Mealer.', 0),

(507, 'LORD', 'n. In American society an English tourist above the state of a costermonger as lord ''Aberdasher Lord Hartisan and so forth. The traveling Briton of lesser degree is addressed as "Sir" as Sir ''Arry Donkiboi or ''Amstead ''Eath. The word "Lord" is sometimes used also as a title of the Supreme Being; but this is thought to be rather flattery than true reverence.', 0),
(508, 'LORE', 'n. Learningâ€”particularly that sort which is not derived from a regular course of instruction but comes of the reading of occult books or by nature. This latter is commonly designated as folk-lore and embraces popularly myths and superstitions. In Baring-Gould''s Curious Myths of the Middle Ages the reader will find many of these traced backward through various people son converging lines toward a common origin in remote antiquity. Among these are the fables of "Teddy the Giant Killer" "The Sleeping John Sharp Williams" "Little Red Riding Hood and the Sugar Trust" "Beauty and the Brisbane" "The Seven Aldermen of Ephesus" "Rip Van Fairbanks" and so forth. The fable with Goethe so affectingly relates under the title of "The Erl-King" was known two thousand years ago in Greece as "The Demos and the Infant Industry." One of the most general and ancient of these myths is that Arabian tale of "Ali Baba and the Forty Rockefellers."', 0),
(509, 'LOSS', 'n. Privation of that which we had or had not. Thus in the latter sense it is said of a defeated candidate that he "lost his election"; and of that eminent man the poet Gilder that he has "lost his mind."', 0),
(510, 'LOVE', 'n. A temporary insanity curable by marriage or by removal of the patient from the influences under which he incurred the disorder. This disease like caries and many other ailments is prevalent only among civilized races living under artificial conditions; barbarous nations breathing pure air and eating simple food enjoy immunity from its ravages. It is sometimes fatal but more frequently to the physician than to the patient.', 0),
(511, 'LOW-BRED', 'adj. "Raised" instead of brought up.', 0),
(512, 'LUMINARY', 'n. One who throws light upon a subject; as an editor by not writing about it.', 0),
(513, 'LUNARIAN', 'n. An inhabitant of the moon as distinguished from Lunatic one whom the moon inhabits. The Lunarians have been described by Lucian Locke and other observers but without much agreement. For example Bragellos avers their anatomical identity with Man but Professor Newcomb says they are more like the hill tribes of Vermont.', 0),
(514, 'LYRE', 'n. An ancient instrument of torture. The word is now used in a figurative sense to denote the poetic faculty.', 0),
(515, 'MACE', 'n. A staff of office signifying authority. Its form that of a heavy club indicates its original purpose and use in dissuading from dissent.', 0),
(516, 'MACHINATION', 'n. The method employed by one''s opponents in baffling one''s open and honorable efforts to do the right thing.', 0),
(517, 'MACROBIAN', 'n. One forgotten of the gods and living to a great age. History is abundantly supplied with examples from Methuselah to Old Parr but some notable instances of longevity are less well known. A Calabrian peasant named Coloni born in 1753 lived so long that he had what he considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal peace. Scanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he could remember a time when he did not deserve hanging. In 1566 a linen draper of Bristol England declared that he had lived five hundred years and that in all that time he had never told a lie. There are instances of longevity (macrobiosis) in our own country. Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better. The editor of The American a newspaper in New York City has a memory that goes back to the time when he was a rascal but not to the fact. The President of the United States was born so long ago that many of the friends of his youth have risen to high political and military preferment without the assistance of personal merit.', 0),
(518, 'MAD', 'adj. Affected with a high degree of intellectual independence; not conforming to standards of thought speech and action derived by the conformants from study of themselves; at odds with the majority; in short unusual. It is noteworthy that persons are pronounced mad by officials destitute of evidence that themselves are sane. For illustration this present (and illustrious) lexicographer is no firmer in the faith of his own sanity than is any inmate of any madhouse in the land; yet for aught he knows to the contrary instead of the lofty occupation that seems to him to be engaging his powers he may really be beating his hands against the window bars of an asylum and declaring himself Noah Webster to the innocent delight of many thoughtless spectators.', 0),
(519, 'MAGDALENE', 'n. An inhabitant of Magdala. Popularly a woman found out. This definition of the word has the authority of ignorance Mary of Magdala being another person than the penitent woman mentioned by St. Luke. It has also the official sanction of the governments of Great Britain and the United States. In England the word is pronounced Maudlin whence maudlin adjective unpleasantly sentimental. With their Maudlin for Magdalene and their Bedlam for Bethlehem the English may justly boast themselves the greatest of revisers.', 0),
(520, 'MAGIC', 'n. An art of converting superstition into coin. There are other arts serving the same high purpose but the discreet lexicographer does not name them.', 0),
(521, 'MAGNET', 'n. Something acted upon by magnetism.', 0),

(523, 'MAGNIFICENT', 'adj. Having a grandeur or splendor superior to that to which the spectator is accustomed as the ears of an ass to a rabbit or the glory of a glowworm to a maggot.', 0),
(524, 'MAGNITUDE', 'n. Size. Magnitude being purely relative nothing is large and nothing small. If everything in the universe were increased in bulk one thousand diameters nothing would be any larger than it was before but if one thing remain unchanged all the others would be larger than they had been. To an understanding familiar with the relativity of magnitude and distance the spaces and masses of the astronomer would be no more impressive than those of the microscopist. For anything we know to the contrary the visible universe may be a small part of an atom with its component ions floating in the life-fluid (luminiferous ether) of some animal. Possibly the wee creatures peopling the corpuscles of our own blood are overcome with the proper emotion when contemplating the unthinkable distance from one of these to another.', 0),
(525, 'MAGPIE', 'n. A bird whose thievish disposition suggested to someone that it might be taught to talk.', 0),
(526, 'MAIDEN', 'n. A young person of the unfair sex addicted to clewless conduct and views that madden to crime. The genus has a wide geographical distribution being found wherever sought and deplored wherever found. The maiden is not altogether unpleasing to the eye nor (without her piano and her views) insupportable to the ear though in respect to comeliness distinctly inferior to the rainbow and with regard to the part of her that is audible bleating out of the field by the canaryâ€”which also is more portable.', 0),
(527, 'MAJESTY', 'n. The state and title of a king. Regarded with a just contempt by the Most Eminent Grand Masters Grand Chancellors Great Incohonees and Imperial Potentates of the ancient and honorable orders of republican America.', 0),

(529, 'MALEFACTOR', 'n. The chief factor in the progress of the human race.', 0),
(530, 'MALTHUSIAN', 'adj. Pertaining to Malthus and his doctrines. Malthus believed in artificially limiting population but found that it could not be done by talking. One of the most practical exponents of the Malthusian idea was Herod of Judea though all the famous soldiers have been of the same way of thinking.', 0),

(533, 'MAN', 'n. An animal so lost in rapturous contemplation of what he thinks he is as to overlook what he indubitably ought to be. His chief occupation is extermination of other animals and his own species which however multiplies with such insistent rapidity as to infest the whole habitable earth and Canada.', 0),

He even attempts to exculpate the mice (such is the malice of bigotry) by declaring that the unfortunate women perished some from exhaustion some of broken necks from falling over their own feet and some from lack of restoratives.

(603, 'NOVEL', 'n. A short story padded. A species of composition bearing the same relation to literature that the panorama bears to art. As it is too long to be read at a sitting the impressions made by its successive parts are successively effaced as in the panorama. Unity totality of effect is impossible; for besides the few pages last read all that is carried in mind is the mere plot of what has gone before. To the romance the novel is what photography is to painting. Its distinguishing principle probability corresponds to the literal actuality of the photograph and puts it distinctly into the category of reporting; whereas the free wing of the romancer enables him to mount to such altitudes of imagination as he may be fitted to attain; and the first three essentials of the literary art are imagination imagination and imagination.

A devil thrown out of a woman by the Archbishop of Rheims ran through the trees pursued by a hundred persons until the open country was reached where by a leap higher than a church spire he escaped into a bird.

A word which some lexicographer has marked obsolete is ever thereafter an object of dread and loathing to the fool writer but if it is a good word and has no exact modern equivalent equally good it is good enough for the good writer. Indeed a writer''s attitude toward "obsolete" words is as true a measure of his literary ability as anything except the character of his work.

(845, 'RIMER', 'n. A poet regarded with indifference or disesteem.', 0),
(846, 'RIOT', 'n. A popular entertainment given to the military by innocent bystanders.', 0),
(847, 'R.I.P.', 'A careless abbreviation of requiescat in pace attesting to indolent goodwill to the dead. however the letters originally meant nothing more than reductus in pulvis.', 0),
(848, 'RITE', 'n. A religious or semi-religious ceremony fixed by law precept or custom with the essential oil of sincerity carefully squeezed out of it.', 0),
(849, 'RITUALISM', 'n. A Dutch Garden of God where He may walk in rectilinear freedom keeping off the grass.', 0),
(850, 'ROAD', 'n. A strip of land along which one may pass from where it is too tiresome to be to where it is futile to go.', 0),
(851, 'ROMANCE', 'n. Fiction that owes no allegiance to the God of Things as They Are. In the novel the writer''s thought is tethered to probability as a domestic horse to the hitching-post but in romance it ranges at will over the entire region of the imaginationâ€”free lawless immune to bit and rein. Your novelist is a poor creature as Carlyle might sayâ€”a mere reporter. He may invent his characters and plot but he must not imagine anything taking place that might not occur albeit his entire narrative is candidly a lie. Why he imposes this hard condition on himself and "drags at each remove a lengthening chain" of his own forging he can explain in ten thick volumes without illuminating by so much as a candle''s ray the black profound of his own ignorance of the matter. There are great novels for great writers have "laid waste their powers" to write them but it remains true that far and away the most fascinating fiction that we have is "The Thousand and One Nights."', 0),
(852, 'ROPE', 'n. An obsolescent appliance for reminding assassins that they too are mortal. It is put about the neck and remains in place one''s whole life long. It has been largely superseded by a more complex electrical device worn upon another part of the person; and this is rapidly giving place to an apparatus known as the preachment.', 0),
(853, 'ROSTRUM', 'n. In Latin the beak of a bird or the prow of a ship. In America a place from which a candidate for office energetically expounds the wisdom virtue and power of the rabble.', 0),
(854, 'ROUNDHEAD', 'n. A member of the Parliamentarian party in the English civil warâ€”so called from his habit of wearing his hair short whereas his enemy the Cavalier wore his long. There were other points of difference between them but the fashion in hair was the fundamental cause of quarrel. The Cavaliers were royalists because the king an indolent fellow found it more convenient to let his hair grow than to wash his neck. This the Roundheads who were mostly barbers and soap-boilers deemed an injury to trade and the royal neck was therefore the object of their particular indignation. Descendants of the belligerents now wear their hair all alike but the fires of animosity enkindled in that ancient strife smoulder to this day beneath the snows of British civility.', 0),
(855, 'RUBBISH', 'n. Worthless matter such as the religions philosophies literatures arts and sciences of the tribes infesting the regions lying due south from Boreaplas.', 0),
(856, 'RUIN', 'v. To destroy. Specifically to destroy a maid''s belief in the virtue of maids.', 0),
(857, 'RUM', 'n. Generically fiery liquors that produce madness in total abstainers.', 0),
(858, 'RUMOR', 'n. A favorite weapon of the assassins of character.', 0),
(859, 'RUSSIAN', 'n. A person with a Caucasian body and a Mongolian soul. A Tartar Emetic.', 0),
(860, 'SABBATH', 'n. A weekly festival having its origin in the fact that God made the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh. Among the Jews observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this is the Christian version: "Remember the seventh day to make thy neighbor keep it wholly." To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient that the Sabbath should be the last day of the week but the Early Fathers of the Church held other views. So great is the sanctity of the day that even where the Lord holds a doubtful and precarious jurisdiction over those who go down to (and down into) the sea it is reverently recognized as is manifest in the following deep-water version of the Fourth Commandment: " Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able,', 0),
(861, 'SACERDOTALIST', 'n. One who holds the belief that a clergyman is a priest. Denial of this momentous doctrine is the hardest challenge that is now flung into the teeth of the Episcopalian church by the Neo-Dictionarians.', 0),
(862, 'SACRAMENT', 'n. A solemn religious ceremony to which several degrees of authority and significance are attached. Rome has seven sacraments but the Protestant churches being less prosperous feel that they can afford only two and these of inferior sanctity. Some of the smaller sects have no sacraments at allâ€”for which mean economy they will indubitable be damned.', 0),
(863, 'SACRED', 'adj. Dedicated to some religious purpose; having a divine character; inspiring solemn thoughts or emotions; as the Dalai Lama of Thibet; the Moogum of M''bwango; the temple of Apes in Ceylon; the Cow in India; the Crocodile, the Cat and the Onion of ancient Egypt; the Mufti of Moosh; the hair of the dog that bit Noah etc.', 0),
(864, 'SANDLOTTER', 'n. A vertebrate mammal holding the political views of Denis Kearney a notorious demagogue of San Francisco whose audiences gathered in the open spaces (sandlots) of the town. True to the traditions of his species this leader of the proletariat was finally bought off by his law-and-order enemies living prosperously silent and dying impenitently rich. But before his treason he imposed upon California a constitution that was a confection of sin in a diction of solecisms. The similarity between the words "sandlotter" and "sansculotte" is problematically significant but indubitably suggestive.', 0),
(865, 'SAFETY-CLUTCH', 'n. A mechanical device acting automatically to prevent the fall of an elevator or cage in case of an accident to the hoisting apparatus.', 0),
(866, 'SAINT', 'n. A dead sinner revised and edited.', 0),
(867, 'SALACITY', 'n. A certain literary quality frequently observed in popular novels especially in those written by women and young girls who give it another name and think that in introducing it they are occupying a neglected field of letters and reaping an overlooked harvest. If they have the misfortune to live long enough they are tormented with a desire to burn their sheaves.', 0),
(868, 'SALAMANDER', 'n. Originally a reptile inhabiting fire; later an anthropomorphous immortal but still a pyrophile. Salamanders are now believed to be extinct the last one of which we have an account having been seen in Carcassonne by the Abbe Belloc who exorcised it with a bucket of holy water.', 0),
(869, 'SARCOPHAGUS', '', 0),
(870, 'SATAN', 'n. One of the Creator''s lamentable mistakes repented in sashcloth and axes. Being instated as an archangel Satan made himself multifariously objectionable and was finally expelled from Heaven. Halfway in his descent he paused bent his head in thought a moment and at last went back. "There is one favor that I should like to ask" said he.', 0),
(871, 'SATIETY', 'n. The feeling that one has for the plate after he has eaten its contents madam.', 0),
(872, 'SATIRE', 'n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the author''s enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness. In this country satire never had more than a sickly and uncertain existence for the soul of it is wit wherein we are dolefully deficient the humor that we mistake for it like all humor being tolerant and sympathetic. Moreover although Americans are "endowed by their Creator" with abundant vice and folly it is not generally known that these are reprehensible qualities wherefore the satirist is popularly regarded as a soul-spirited knave and his ever victim''s outcry for codefendants evokes a national assent.', 0),
(873, 'SATYR', 'n. One of the few characters of the Grecian mythology accorded recognition in the Hebrew. (Leviticus xvii 7.) The satyr was at first a member of the dissolute community acknowledging a loose allegiance with Dionysius but underwent many transformations and improvements. Not infrequently he is confounded with the faun a later and decenter creation of the Romans who was less like a man and more like a goat.', 0),
(874, 'SAUCE', 'n. The one infallible sign of civilization and enlightenment. A people with no sauces has one thousand vices; a people with one sauce has only nine hundred and ninety-nine. For every sauce invented and accepted a vice is renounced and forgiven.', 0),
(875, 'SAW', 'n. A trite popular saying or proverb. (Figurative and colloquial.) So called because it makes its way into a wooden head. Following are examples of old saws fitted with new teeth.', 0),
(876, 'SCARABAEUS', 'n. The sacred beetle of the ancient Egyptians allied to our familiar "tumble-bug." It was supposed to symbolize immortality the fact that God knew why giving it its peculiar sanctity. Its habit of incubating its eggs in a ball of ordure may also have commended it to the favor of the priesthood and may some day assure it an equal reverence among ourselves. True the American beetle is an inferior beetle but the American priest is an inferior priest.', 0),
(877, 'SCARABEE', 'n. The same as scarabaeus.', 0),
(878, 'SCARIFICATION', 'n. A form of penance practised by the mediaeval pious. The rite was performed sometimes with a knife sometimes with a hot iron but always says Arsenius Asceticus acceptably if the penitent spared himself no pain nor harmless disfigurement. Scarification with other crude penances has now been superseded by benefaction. The founding of a library or endowment of a university is said to yield to the penitent a sharper and more lasting pain than is conferred by the knife or iron and is therefore a surer means of grace. There are however two grave objections to it as a penitential method: the good that it does and the taint of justice.', 0),
(879, 'SCEPTER', 'n. A king''s staff of office the sign and symbol of his authority. It was originally a mace with which the sovereign admonished his jester and vetoed ministerial measures by breaking the bones of their proponents.', 0),
(880, 'SCIMETAR', 'n. A curved sword of exceeding keenness in the conduct of which certain Orientals attain a surprising proficiency as the incident here related will serve to show. The account is translated from the Japanese by Shusi Itama a famous writer of the thirteenth century.', 0),
(881, 'SCRAP-BOOK', 'n. A book that is commonly edited by a fool. Many persons of some small distinction compile scrap-books containing whatever they happen to read about themselves or employ others to collect.', 0),
(882, 'SCRIBBLER', 'n. A professional writer whose views are antagonistic to one''s own.', 0),
(883, 'SCRIPTURES', 'n. The sacred books of our holy religion as distinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other faiths are based.', 0),
(884, 'SEAL', 'n. A mark impressed upon certain kinds of documents to attest their authenticity and authority. Sometimes it is stamped upon wax and attached to the paper sometimes into the paper itself. Sealing in this sense is a survival of an ancient custom of inscribing important papers with cabalistic words or signs to give them a magical efficacy independent of the authority that they represent. In the British museum are preserved many ancient papers mostly of a sacerdotal character validated by necromantic pentagrams and other devices frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are appended now. As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless custom rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote utility it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really useful. Our word "sincere" is derived from sine cero without wax but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny. Either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis. The initials L.S. commonly appended to signatures of legal documents mean locum sigillis the place of the seal although the seal is no longer used â€”an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish. The words locum sigillis are humbly suggested as a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take their place as a sovereign State of the American Union.', 0),
(885, 'SEINE', 'n. A kind of net for effecting an involuntary change of environment. For fish it is made strong and coarse, but women are more easily taken with a singularly delicate fabric weighted with small, cut stones.', 0),

(889, 'SENATE', 'n. A body of elderly gentlemen charged with high duties and misdemeanors.', 0);
INSERT INTO `word` (`word_id`, `word`, `definition`, `is_featured`) VALUES
(890, 'SERIAL', 'n. A literary work usually a story that is not true creeping through several issues of a newspaper or magazine. Frequently appended to each installment is a "synposis of preceding chapters" for those who have not read them but a direr need is a synposis of succeeding chapters for those who do not intend to read them. A synposis of the entire work would be still better.', 0),
(891, 'SEVERALTY', 'n. Separateness as lands in severalty i.e. lands held individually not in joint ownership. Certain tribes of Indians are believed now to be sufficiently civilized to have in severalty the lands that they have hitherto held as tribal organizations and could not sell to the Whites for waxen beads and potato whiskey.', 0),
(892, 'SHERIFF', 'n. In America the chief executive office of a country whose most characteristic duties in some of the Western and Southern States are the catching and hanging of rogues.', 0),
(893, 'SIREN', 'n. One of several musical prodigies famous for a vain attempt to dissuade Odysseus from a life on the ocean wave. Figuratively any lady of splendid promise, dissembled purpose and disappointing performance.', 0),
(894, 'SLANG', 'n. The grunt of the human hog (Pignoramus intolerabilis) with an audible memory. The speech of one who utters with his tongue what he thinks with his ear and feels the pride of a creator in accomplishing the feat of a parrot. A means (under Providence) of setting up as a wit without a capital of sense.', 0),
(895, 'SMITHAREEN', 'n. A fragment a decomponent part a remain. The word is used variously but in the following verse on a noted female reformer who opposed bicycle-riding by women because it "led them to the devil" it is seen at its best:', 0),
(896, 'SOPHISTRY', 'n. The controversial method of an opponent distinguished from one''s own by superior insincerity and fooling. This method is that of the later Sophists a Grecian sect of philosophers who began by teaching wisdom, prudence, science, art and in brief whatever men ought to know but lost themselves in a maze of quibbles and a fog of words.', 0),
(897, 'SORCERY', 'n. The ancient prototype and forerunner of political influence. It was however deemed less respectable and sometimes was punished by torture and death. Augustine Nicholas relates that a poor peasant who had been accused of sorcery was put to the torture to compel a confession. After enduring a few gentle agonies the suffering simpleton admitted his guilt but naively asked his tormentors if it were not possible to be a sorcerer without knowing it.', 0),
(898, 'SOUL', 'n. A spiritual entity concerning which there hath been brave disputation. Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of existence (antedating Athens) had obtained the clearest glimpses of eternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became philosophers. Plato himself was a philosopher. The souls that had least contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and despots. Dionysius I who had threatened to decapitate the broad-browed philosopher was a usurper and a despot. Plato doubtless was not the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted against his enemies; certainly he was not the last.', 0),
(899, 'SPOOKER', 'n. A writer whose imagination concerns itself with supernatural phenomena especially in the doings of spooks. One of the most illustrious spookers of our time is Mr. William D. Howells who introduces a well-credentialed reader to as respectable and mannerly a company of spooks as one could wish to meet. To the terror that invests the chairman of a district school board the Howells ghost adds something of the mystery enveloping a farmer from another township.', 0),
(900, 'STORY', 'n. A narrative commonly untrue. The truth of the stories here following has however not been successfully impeached.', 0),
(901, 'SUCCESS', 'n. The one unpardonable sin against one''s fellows.', 0),
(902, 'SUFFRAGE', 'n. Expression of opinion by means of a ballot. The right of suffrage (which is held to be both a privilege and a duty) means as commonly interpreted the right to vote for the man of another man''s choice and is highly prized. Refusal to do so has the bad name of "incivism." The incivilian however cannot be properly arraigned for his crime for there is no legitimate accuser. If the accuser is himself guilty he has no standing in the court of opinion; if not he profits by the crime for A''s abstention from voting gives greater weight to the vote of B. By female suffrage is meant the right of a woman to vote as some man tells her to. It is based on female responsibility which is somewhat limited. The woman most eager to jump out of her petticoat to assert her rights is first to jump back into it when threatened with a switching for misusing them.', 0),
(903, 'SYCOPHANT', 'n. One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he may not be commanded to turn and be kicked. He is sometimes an editor.', 0),
(904, 'SYLLOGISM', 'n. A logical formula consisting of a major and a minor assumption and an inconsequent. (See LOGIC.)', 0),
(905, 'SYLPH', 'n. An immaterial but visible being that inhabited the air when the air was an element and before it was fatally polluted with factory smoke sewer gas and similar products of civilization. Sylphs were allied to gnomes nymphs and salamanders which dwelt respectively in earth water and fire all now insalubrious. Sylphs like fowls of the air were male and female to no purpose apparently for if they had progeny they must have nested in accessible places none of the chicks having ever been seen.', 0),
(906, 'SYMBOL', 'n. Something that is supposed to typify or stand for something else. Many symbols are mere "survivals"â€”things which having no longer any utility continue to exist because we have inherited the tendency to make them; as funereal urns carved on memorial monuments. They were once real urns holding the ashes of the dead. We cannot stop making them but we can give them a name that conceals our helplessness.', 0),
(907, 'SYMBOLIC', 'adj. Pertaining to symbols and the use and interpretation of symbols.', 0),
(908, 'T', 'the twentieth letter of the English alphabet was by the Greeks absurdly called tau. In the alphabet whence ours comes it had the form of the rude corkscrew of the period and when it stood alone (which was more than the Phoenicians could always do) signified Tallegal translated by the learned Dr. Brownrigg "tanglefoot."', 0),
(909, 'TABLE D''HOTE', 'n. A caterer''s thrifty concession to the universal passion for irresponsibility.', 0),
(910, 'TAIL', 'n. The part of an animal''s spine that has transcended its natural limitations to set up an independent existence in a world of its own. Excepting in its foetal state Man is without a tail a privation of which he attests an hereditary and uneasy consciousness by the coat-skirt of the male and the train of the female and by a marked tendency to ornament that part of his attire where the tail should be and indubitably once was. This tendency is most observable in the female of the species in whom the ancestral sense is strong and persistent. The tailed men described by Lord Monboddo are now generally regarded as a product of an imagination unusually susceptible to influences generated in the golden age of our pithecan past.', 0),
(911, 'TAKE', 'v.t. To acquire frequently by force but preferably by stealth.', 0),
(912, 'TALK', 'v.t. To commit an indiscretion without temptation from an impulse without purpose.', 0),
(913, 'TARIFF', 'n. A scale of taxes on imports designed to protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer.', 0),
(914, 'TECHNICALITY', 'n. In an English court a man named Home was tried for slander in having accused his neighbor of murder. His exact words were: "Sir Thomas Holt hath taken a cleaver and stricken his cook upon the head so that one side of the head fell upon one shoulder and the other side upon the other shoulder." The defendant was acquitted by instruction of the court the learned judges holding that the words did not charge murder for they did not affirm the death of the cook that being only an inference.', 0),
(915, 'TEDIUM', 'n. Ennui the state or condition of one that is bored. Many fanciful derivations of the word have been affirmed but so high an authority as Father Jape says that it comes from a very obvious sourceâ€”the first words of the ancient Latin hymn Te Deum Laudamus. In this apparently natural derivation there is something that saddens.', 0),
(916, 'TEETOTALER', 'n. One who abstains from strong drink sometimes totally sometimes tolerably totally.', 0),
(917, 'TELEPHONE', 'n. An invention of the devil which abrogates some of the advantages of making a disagreeable person keep his distance.', 0),
(918, 'TELESCOPE', 'n. A device having a relation to the eye similar to that of the telephone to the ear enabling distant objects to plague us with a multitude of needless details. Luckily it is unprovided with a bell summoning us to the sacrifice.', 0),
(919, 'TENACITY', 'n. A certain quality of the human hand in its relation to the coin of the realm. It attains its highest development in the hand of authority and is considered a serviceable equipment for a career in politics.', 0),
(920, 'THEOSOPHY', 'n. An ancient faith having all the certitude of religion and all the mystery of science. The modern Theosophist holds with the Buddhists that we live an incalculable number of times on this earth in as many several bodies because one life is not long enough for our complete spiritual development; that is a single lifetime does not suffice for us to become as wise and good as we choose to wish to become. To be absolutely wise and goodâ€”that is perfection; and the Theosophist is so keen-sighted as to have observed that everything desirous of improvement eventually attains perfection. Less competent observers are disposed to except cats which seem neither wiser nor better than they were last year. The greatest and fattest of recent Theosophists was the late Madame Blavatsky who had no cat.', 0),
(921, 'TIGHTS', 'n. An habiliment of the stage designed to reinforce the general acclamation of the press agent with a particular publicity. Public attention was once somewhat diverted from this garment to Miss Lillian Russell''s refusal to wear it and many were the conjectures as to her motive the guess of Miss Pauline Hall showing a high order of ingenuity and sustained reflection. It was Miss Hall''s belief that nature had not endowed Miss Russell with beautiful legs. This theory was impossible of acceptance by the male understanding but the conception of a faulty female leg was of so prodigious originality as to rank among the most brilliant feats of philosophical speculation! It is strange that in all the controversy regarding Miss Russell''s aversion to tights no one seems to have thought to ascribe it to what was known among the ancients as "modesty." The nature of that sentiment is now imperfectly understood and possibly incapable of exposition with the vocabulary that remains to us. The study of lost arts has however been recently revived and some of the arts themselves recovered. This is an epoch of renaissances and there is ground for hope that the primitive "blush" may be dragged from its hiding-place amongst the tombs of antiquity and hissed on to the stage.', 0),
(922, 'TOMB', 'n. The House of Indifference. Tombs are now by common consent invested with a certain sanctity but when they have been long tenanted it is considered no sin to break them open and rifle them the famous Egyptologist Dr. Huggyns explaining that a tomb may be innocently "glened" as soon as its occupant is done "smellynge" the soul being then all exhaled. This reasonable view is now generally accepted by archaeologists whereby the noble science of Curiosity has been greatly dignified.', 0),
(923, 'TOPE', 'v. To tipple booze, swill, soak, guzzle, lush, bib or swig. In the individual toping is regarded with disesteem but toping nations are in the forefront of civilization and power. When pitted against the hard-drinking Christians the abstemious Mahometans go down like grass before the scythe. In India one hundred thousand beef-eating and brandy-and-soda guzzling Britons hold in subjection two hundred and fifty million vegetarian abstainers of the same Aryan race. With what an easy grace the whisky-loving American pushed the temperate Spaniard out of his possessions! From the time when the Berserkers ravaged all the coasts of western Europe and lay drunk in every conquered port it has been the same way: everywhere the nations that drink too much are observed to fight rather well and not too righteously. Wherefore the estimable old ladies who abolished the canteen from the American army may justly boast of having materially augmented the nation''s military power.', 0),
(924, 'TORTOISE', 'n. A creature thoughtfully created to supply occasion for the following lines by the illustrious Ambat Delaso:', 0),
(925, 'TREE', 'n. A tall vegetable intended by nature to serve as a penal apparatus though through a miscarriage of justice most trees bear only a negligible fruit or none at all. When naturally fruited the tree is a beneficient agency of civilization and an important factor in public morals. In the stern West and the sensitive South its fruit (white and black respectively) though not eaten is agreeable to the public taste and though not exported profitable to the general welfare.', 0),
(926, 'TRIAL', 'n. A formal inquiry designed to prove and put upon record the blameless characters of judges advocates and jurors. In order to effect this purpose it is necessary to supply a contrast in the person of one who is called the defendant the prisoner or the accused. If the contrast is made sufficiently clear this person is made to undergo such an affliction as will give the virtuous gentlemen a comfortable sense of their immunity added to that of their worth. In our day the accused is usually a human being or a socialist but in mediaeval times animals fishes reptiles and insects were brought to trial. A beast that had taken human life or practiced sorcery was duly arrested tried and if condemned put to death by the public executioner. Insects ravaging grain fields orchards or vineyards were cited to appeal by counsel before a civil tribunal argument and condemnation if they continued in contumaciam the matter was taken to a high ecclesiastical court where they were solemnly excommunicated and anathematized. In a street of Toledo some pigs that had wickedly run between the viceroy''s legs upsetting him were arrested on a warrant tried and punished. In Naples and ass was condemned to be burned at the stake but the sentence appears not to have been executed. D''Addosio relates from the court records many trials of pigs bulls, horses, cocks, dogs, goats, etc. it is believed to the betterment of their conduct and morals. In 1451 a suit was brought against the leeches infesting some ponds about Berne and the Bishop of Lausanne instructed by the faculty of Heidelberg University directed that some of "the aquatic worms" be brought before the local magistracy. This was done and the leeches both present and absent were ordered to leave the places that they had infested within three days on pain of incurring "the malediction of God." In the voluminous records of this cause celebre nothing is found to show whether the offenders braved the punishment or departed forthwith out of that inhospitable jurisdiction.', 0),
(927, 'TRICHINOSIS', 'n. The pig''s reply to proponents of porcophagy.', 0),
(928, 'TRINITY', 'n. In the multiplex theism of certain Christian churches three entirely distinct deities consistent with only one. Subordinate deities of the polytheistic faith such as devils and angels are not dowered with the power of combination and must urge individually their claims to adoration and propitiation. The Trinity is one of the most sublime mysteries of our holy religion. In rejecting it because it is incomprehensible Unitarians betray their inadequate sense of theological fundamentals. In religion we believe only what we do not understand except in the instance of an intelligible doctrine that contradicts an incomprehensible one. In that case we believe the former as a part of the latter.', 0),
(929, 'TROGLODYTE', 'n. Specifically a cave-dweller of the paleolithic period after the Tree and before the Flat. A famous community of troglodytes dwelt with David in the Cave of Adullam. The colony consisted of "every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented"â€”in brief all the Socialists of Judah.', 0),
(930, 'TRUCE', 'n. Friendship.', 0),

(938, 'UBIQUITY', 'n. The gift or power of being in all places at one time but not in all places at all times which is omnipresence an attribute of God and the luminiferous ether only. This important distinction between ubiquity and omnipresence was not clear to the mediaeval Church and there was much bloodshed about it. Certain Lutherans who affirmed the presence everywhere of Christ''s body were known as Ubiquitarians. For this error they were doubtless damned for Christ''s body is present only in the eucharist though that sacrament may be performed in more than one place simultaneously. In recent times ubiquity has not always been understoodâ€”not even by Sir Boyle Roche for example who held that a man cannot be in two places at once unless he is a bird.', 0),

(942, 'UNCTION', 'n. An oiling or greasing. The rite of extreme unction consists in touching with oil consecrated by a bishop several parts of the body of one engaged in dying. Marbury relates that after the rite had been administered to a certain wicked English nobleman it was discovered that the oil had not been properly consecrated and no other could be obtained. When informed of this the sick man said in anger: "Then I''ll be damned if I die!"', 0),

(946, 'URBANITY', 'n. The kind of civility that urban observers ascribe to dwellers in all cities but New York. Its commonest expression is heard in the words "I beg your pardon" and it is not consistent with disregard of the rights of others.', 0),

(954, 'W (double U) has', 'of all the letters in our alphabet the only cumbrous name the names of the others being monosyllabic. This advantage of the Roman alphabet over the Grecian is the more valued after audibly spelling out some simple Greek word like epixoriambikos. Still it is now thought by the learned that other agencies than the difference of the two alphabets may have been concerned in the decline of "the glory that was Greece" and the rise of "the grandeur that was Rome." There can be no doubt however that by simplifying the name of W (calling it "wow" for example) our civilization could be if not promoted at least better endured.', 0),
(955, 'WALL STREET', 'n. A symbol for sin for every devil to rebuke. That Wall Street is a den of thieves is a belief that serves every unsuccessful thief in place of a hope in Heaven. Even the great and good Andrew Carnegie has made his profession of faith in the matter.', 0),
(956, 'WAR', 'n. A by-product of the arts of peace. The most menacing political condition is a period of international amity. The student of history who has not been taught to expect the unexpected may justly boast himself inaccessible to the light. "In time of peace prepare for war" has a deeper meaning than is commonly discerned; it means not merely that all things earthly have an endâ€”that change is the one immutable and eternal lawâ€”but that the soil of peace is thickly sown with the seeds of war and singularly suited to their germination and growth.', 0),
(957, 'WASHINGTONIAN', 'n. A Potomac tribesman who exchanged the privilege of governing himself for the advantage of good government. In justice to him it should be said that he did not want to.', 0),
(958, 'WEAKNESSES', 'n.pl. Certain primal powers of Tyrant Woman wherewith she holds dominion over the male of her species binding him to the service of her will and paralyzing his rebellious energies.', 0),
(959, 'WEATHER', 'n. The climate of the hour. A permanent topic of conversation among persons whom it does not interest but who have inherited the tendency to chatter about it from naked arboreal ancestors whom it keenly concerned. The setting up official weather bureaus and their maintenance in mendacity prove that even governments are accessible to suasion by the rude forefathers of the jungle.', 0),
(960, 'WEDDING', 'n. A ceremony at which two persons undertake to become one, one undertakes to become nothing, and nothing undertakes to become supportable.', 0),
(961, 'WEREWOLF', 'n. A wolf that was once or is sometimes a man. All werewolves are of evil disposition having assumed a bestial form to gratify a beastial appetite but some transformed by sorcery are as humane and is consistent with an acquired taste for human flesh.', 0),

(963, 'WHEAT', 'n. A cereal from which a tolerably good whisky can with some difficulty be made and which is used also for bread. The French are said to eat more bread per capita of population than any other people which is natural for only they know how to make the stuff palatable.', 0),
(964, 'WHITE', 'adj. and n. Black.', 1),

(970, 'WORMS''-MEAT', 'n. The finished product of which we are the raw material. The contents of the Taj Mahal the Tombeau Napoleon and the Granitarium. Worms''-meat is usually outlasted by the structure that houses it but "this too must pass away." Probably the silliest work in which a human being can engage is construction of a tomb for himself. The solemn purpose cannot dignify but only accentuates by contrast the foreknown futility.', 0),
(971, 'WORSHIP', 'n. Homo Creator''s testimony to the sound construction and fine finish of Deus Creatus. A popular form of abjection having an element of pride.', 0),
(972, 'WRATH', 'n. Anger of a superior quality and degree appropriate to exalted characters and momentous occasions; as "the wrath of God" "the day of wrath" etc. Amongst the ancients the wrath of kings was deemed sacred for it could usually command the agency of some god for its fit manifestation as could also that of a priest. The Greeks before Troy were so harried by Apollo that they jumped out of the frying-pan of the wrath of Cryses into the fire of the wrath of Achilles though Agamemnon the sole offender was neither fried nor roasted. A similar noted immunity was that of David when he incurred the wrath of Yahveh by numbering his people seventy thousand of whom paid the penalty with their lives. God is now Love and a director of the census performs his work without apprehension of disaster.', 0),
(973, 'X', 'in our alphabet being a needless letter has an added invincibility to the attacks of the spelling reformers and like them will doubtless last as long as the language. X is the sacred symbol of ten dollars and in such words as Xmas, Xn etc. stands for Christ not as is popular supposed because it represents a cross but because the corresponding letter in the Greek alphabet is the initial of his name â€”Xristos. If it represented a cross it would stand for St. Andrew who "testified" upon one of that shape. In the algebra of psychology x stands for Woman''s mind. Words beginning with X are Grecian and will not be defined in this standard English dictionary.', 0),
(974, 'YANKEE', 'n. In Europe, an American. In the Northern States of our Union a New Englander. In the Southern States the word is unknown. (See DAMNYANK.)', 0),

(977, 'YOKE', 'n. An implement madam to whose Latin name jugum we owe one of the most illuminating words in our languageâ€”a word that defines the matrimonial situation with precision point and poignancy. A thousand apologies for withholding it.', 0),
(978, 'YOUTH', 'n. The Period of Possibility when Archimedes finds a fulcrum Cassandra has a following and seven cities compete for the honor of endowing a living Homer.', 0),
(979, 'ZANY', 'n. A popular character in old Italian plays who imitated with ludicrous incompetence the buffone or clown and was therefore the ape of an ape; for the clown himself imitated the serious characters of the play. The zany was progenitor to the specialist in humor as we to-day have the unhappiness to know him. In the zany we see an example of creation; in the humorist of transmission. Another excellent specimen of the modern zany is the curate, who apes the rector, who apes the bishop, who apes the archbishop who apes the devil.', 0),
(980, 'ZANZIBARI', 'n. An inhabitant of the Sultanate of Zanzibar off the eastern coast of Africa. The Zanzibaris a warlike people are best known in this country through a threatening diplomatic incident that occurred a few years ago. The American consul at the capital occupied a dwelling that faced the sea with a sandy beach between. Greatly to the scandal of this official''s family and against repeated remonstrances of the official himself the people of the city persisted in using the beach for bathing. One day a woman came down to the edge of the water and was stooping to remove her attire (a pair of sandals) when the consul incensed beyond restraint fired a charge of bird-shot into the most conspicuous part of her person. Unfortunately for the existing entente cordiale between two great nations she was the Sultana.', 0),
(981, 'ZEAL', 'n. A certain nervous disorder afflicting the young and inexperienced. A passion that goeth before a sprawl.', 1),
(982, 'ZENITH', 'n. The point in the heavens directly overhead to a man standing or a growing cabbage. A man in bed or a cabbage in the pot is not considered as having a zenith though from this view of the matter there was once a considerably dissent among the learned some holding that the posture of the body was immaterial. These were called Horizontalists their opponents Verticalists. The Horizontalist heresy was finally extinguished by Xanobus the philosopher-king of Abara a zealous Verticalist. Entering an assembly of philosophers who were debating the matter he cast a severed human head at the feet of his opponents and asked them to determine its zenith explaining that its body was hanging by the heels outside. Observing that it was the head of their leader the Horizontalists hastened to profess themselves converted to whatever opinion the Crown might be pleased to hold and Horizontalism took its place among fides defuncti.', 0),
(983, 'ZEUS', 'n. The chief of Grecian gods adored by the Romans as Jupiter and by the modern Americans as God Gold Mob and Dog. Some explorers who have touched upon the shores of America and one who professes to have penetrated a considerable distance to the interior have thought that these four names stand for as many distinct deities but in his monumental work on Surviving Faiths Frumpp insists that the natives are monotheists each having no other god than himself whom he worships under many sacred names.', 0),
(984, 'ZIGZAG', 'v.t. To move forward uncertainly from side to side as one carrying the white man''s burden. (From zed z and jag an Icelandic word of unknown meaning.)', 0),
(985, 'ZOOLOGY', 'n. The science and history of the animal kingdom including its king the House Fly (Musca maledicta). The father of Zoology was Aristotle as is universally conceded but the name of its mother has not come down to us.
